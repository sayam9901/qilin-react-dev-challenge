# Qilin Software Lab - Junior React Developer Pre-Assessment

Welcome to the Junior React Developer pre-assessment for Qilin Software Lab. This assessment is designed to evaluate your React.js skills. Please follow the instructions below to complete the assessment.

## Task Overview

### 1. Form Validation (File: RegistrationForm.js)

Create a React component named RegistrationForm that includes a form for user registration. Implement form validation to ensure that the user enters a valid email address, a password with at least 8 characters, and a matching password confirmation. Provide appropriate error messages.

### 2. API Integration and Display (File: GitHubUser.js)

Build a React component named GitHubUser that takes a GitHub username as a prop and fetches the user's information from the GitHub API. Display the user's profile picture, username, and a list of repositories. Handle loading and error states gracefully.

### 3. Context API for Theme (File: ThemeSwitcher.js)

Implement a theme-switching feature using the Context API. Create a ThemeContext that manages the current theme (light or dark). Build two child components, LightTheme and DarkTheme, that display content differently based on the selected theme. Include a button in a parent component to toggle between themes.

### 4. Higher-Order Component (HOC) (File: Logger.js)

Develop a higher-order component named `Logger` that logs the lifecycle methods of a wrapped component. Wrap a simple component with the `Logger` HOC and observe the lifecycle events in the console.

### 5. Routing and Lazy Loading (Files: App.js, Home.js, About.js)

Set up a React application with routing and lazy loading for optimized performance. Create two pages, `Home` and `About`, and use React Router to navigate between them.
